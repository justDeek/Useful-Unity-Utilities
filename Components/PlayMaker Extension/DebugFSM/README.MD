## DebugFSM.cs
![Image](/Screenshots/Components/DebugFSM_Info.png)

Useful for debugging FSM related information at runtime.

Divided into two separate modes:
States - Shows the active state and as many of the previous states as selected. Also show, how long it was in the previous state.
Variables - Displays all available variables and their live-action values

Most options change how and where the information is displayed.
It's also possible to debug both modes on the same GameObject by using this component twice.
